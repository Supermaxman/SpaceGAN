DONE:
 - Improve dataset
   x Remove images with wildly varying statistics (Super red / malformed)
   x Remove ultra sparse images so pure black space 512x512 does not exist in true set
 - More True image transformations for reduced overfitting of Discriminator
   x Rotation
   x Flipping: Horizontal and Vertical
   x Consider other transformations
 - Sampling code
   x Use proper gan normal noise sampling techniques
   x Write code to output samples in collage

TODO:
 - InfoGAN Continuous noise would be cool
    - Number of stars
    - Colors
    - Brightness
 - Log interpolation of random noise variables
   - More images with fixed z and changing InfoGan c
 - Larger images
   - 256x256 or 512x512 unlikely on GTX 1080, will need better hardware
 - Write up technical paper for writing experience, post on arxiv
   - Include discussion on dataset construction and preparation
   - Discuss challenges with dataset
   - Include experiments and samples
   - Cite relevant prior work and papers implemented
